## About ##
This project was created as a term project for ITCS 3112 - Objected Oriented Programming. 

This project creates a randomly generated environment and a number of Creatures that initially exist within it. The program performs a user-set number of iterations and as it iterates, creatures interact with the environment an each other - changing their population (gaining/losing members of the population), breeding, or mutating.

Once all iterations have completed, the program generates a chart representing how the species populations have changed over the course of the iterations. Specifics for this data is available to the user in the form of a table.
